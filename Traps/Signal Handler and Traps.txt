Signals are a way of communicating between two processes in Linux.

>>> kill -l
>>> kill -l | more for better navigation

TRAPING SIGNAL i.e Receiving the Signal
Syntax :

    trap somecommand signal1 signal2 ... signalN

ctrl + C : really is a signal (SIGINT)
ctrl + Z : Suspends a command and sends to background
kill -9 (SIGKILL) can't be trapped

* Usually trap is done at the top of the file.
Whenever you are putting a trap from then onwards the signal becomes
active. exx: before a loop

Hint: 
    When doing signal handling always use /bin/bash not /bin/ksh
they are differents in terms of signal handling 

>>> awk '{print $4}' print 4th column

>>> df ; df | grep tmps | tail -1

>>> ps -ef | grep -i processname

>>> man signal
